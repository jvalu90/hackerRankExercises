/*
A very big sum

In this challenge, you are required to calculate and print the sum of the elements in an array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.

Function Description

Complete the aVeryBigSum function in the editor below. It must return the sum of all array elements.

aVeryBigSum has the following parameter(s):

    int ar[n]: an array of integers .

Return

    long: the sum of all array elements

Input Format

The first line of the input consists of an integer
.
The next line contains

space-separated integers contained in the array.

Output Format

Return the integer sum of the elements in the array.

/*
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix

is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  

The left-to-right diagonal =
. The right to left diagonal = . Their absolute difference is

.

Function description

Complete the

function in the editor below.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

    int arr[n][m]: an array of integers

Return

    int: the absolute diagonal difference

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer,
, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix .
Each of the next lines describes a row, , and consists of space-separated integers

.

Constraints

Output Format

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.
